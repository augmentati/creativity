Rick Rubin:

    We never try to judge and idea based on the description of an idea.  We always
    musically try an idea â€” which is a pretty important point.  I can think of a time
    when I'll say: "The bridge in this song isn't good enough, can we write a new
    part?" and then the artist will say "Oh yeah, I have an idea. We can do it like
    this!" and they'll give me a description of what it is and it sounds terrible. The
    description sounds terrible. I say "Great, I can't wait to hear it."  And then
    they do it, and it's incredible!

    The reason is that it's very difficult to explain a musical idea. If I tell you
    something I'm hearing, the thing you hear is going to be completely different
    than the thing I'm hearing.  So we never rely on the explanation being what it is;
    it's always "Show it to me!" or "Let me hear it."
